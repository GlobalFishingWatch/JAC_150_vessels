## Investigation of ‘150’ MMSI prefix vessels

This repository is designed to identify and describe the activities of
vessels which are members of a fleet of likely Chinese Squid jiggers.
The vessels are characterised by having and MMSI prefix ‘150’ and
consistently changing their name transmitted on AIS while operating.
Individual vessels in this fleet have been the subject of two Joint
Analytical Cell (JAC) intelligence reports (001a-c, 004). This analysis
aims to investigate and describe the general trends of the fleet.

This also serves as a place for Max to get used to GFW data, queries,
gfwr package and the github and Rstudio workflow.
